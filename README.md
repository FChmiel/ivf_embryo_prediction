# IVF embryo prediction
This project investigated the probabilty of an IVF patient having an embryo suitable for D5 transfer or freezing.

# Data source

The models developed in this project were built and validated using the anonymised register of IVF cycles maintained by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). This data is available [freely online](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/our-data/) to researchers.

# Usage

#### Investigating the models predictions
If you would like to explore the models predictions we suggest testing the accompanying web application:

#### Investigating the model development
An example model development process is presented in the jupyter notebook *HFEA_prediction_model.ipynb* included in this repository. It can be viewed [in-browser](https://github.com/FChmiel/ivf_embryo_prediction/blob/master/HFEA_prediction_model.ipynb) or the repo can be cloned locally if you would like to run the model building process.
